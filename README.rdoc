== node-marshal

This gem is designed for transformation of Ruby source code (eiher in the form of files or strings) to the 
Ruby nodes (syntax trees) used by Ruby MRI internals. Obtained nodes can be serialized to the platform-dependent
binary or ASCII strings and restored and launched from serialized format. Such kind of transformation is
irreversible and can be used for source code protection; the similar principle is used by RubyEncoder commercial
software.

The key features of node-marshal gem:
- Irreversible conversion of a source code to the Ruby node (abstract syntax tree)
- Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.2.x support (only MRI)
- Active usage of Ruby internals (mainly AST) and Ruby standard library (Marshal and Zlib)
- Set of tests for easy addition of new Ruby versions
- Result of compilation depends on Ruby version and used platform (x86, x64 etc.)
- 2-clause BSD license suitable for creation of custom source code protection system
